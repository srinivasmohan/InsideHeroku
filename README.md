Overview
========

This is a sample app to look inside a Heroku instance. The idea was to see what Heroku means by a "Dyno" but turns out that running Ohai on a Heroku instance knocks out most of the cloud specific info you would otherwise get from running Ohai on your own EC2/Rackspace instance.

See http://www.onepwr.org/inside-heroku for details.
